First thank you for downloading oUF_Sniffles!

----------------/!\-------------/!\-----------------
If you don't want to learn .LUA or you don't know a bit .LUA this AddOns is probably NOT FOR YOU.
----------------/!\-------------/!\-----------------

Be sure that "media.lua, cfg.lua, core.lua" is on top in the .xml file. Or you will get .LUA Errors.
If you want more config options then say it to me please on wowI. If you found a bug, or you want to request a feature, please
contact me on wowI. This Layout is in BETA, so I'll change much. It's designed for PvP/BG's. Please, don't
hope that I'll Raid PlugIns like "oUF_debuffhightlight or oUF_RaidDebuffs" because I'm a PvP Player.
